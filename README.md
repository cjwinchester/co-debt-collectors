# Colorado debt collectors

A Jupyter notebook that uses [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) to extract tables from [a PDF of debt collectors licensed in Colorado](https://coag.gov/sites/default/files/contentuploads/cp/ConsumerCreditUnit/InternetReports/carreport_0.pdf) and load the data into `pandas` for some basic analysis.

### Run the notebook
